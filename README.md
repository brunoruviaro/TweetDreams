Requirements
------------

You'll need a machine with the following:

1. Python (only 2.6 or 2.7 have been tested), with the `virtualenv` module installed
2. Java
3. Chuck

**Note:** the code should be cross-platform, but it has only been tested in OS X (10.5 and 10.6)


Installation
------------

**1) Get the code**

	> git clone git@github.com:jorgehatccrma/TweetDreams.git
	
or download it from  https://github.com/jorgehatccrma/TweetDreams/zipball/master


**2) Initialize**

Go to the root folder of the downloaded code and type

	> source init.sh
	
(the containing folder will become a virtual python environment and all the dependencies will be downloaded and installed in this isolated virtual environment)

**3) Run it** 

(TODO)
